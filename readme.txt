Just create a directory called "decrypted".  Put text files in it.  Call them whatever.  Put your
deepest, darkest personal thoughts in there.  Then run `./lock` to encrypt the files and erase the
originals.  You will be prompted for a password.  Run `./unlock` to rewrite the decrypted directory
based on the encrpyted dir.  You will need to input the same password you used to lock your journal.
